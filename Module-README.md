# Project Overview

A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

The application is invoked with the following command:

node index.js

- When the user is prompted for information about their application repository, a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

- When they enter the project title, it is displayed as the title of the README.

- When they enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

- When the user chooses a license for the application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added under the Licenses section.

- When the user enters their GitHub username and email address, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile and instructions on how to reach out with additional questions.

- When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
